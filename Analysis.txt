Task0: 
O(1) 
To access an array with a given index, first or last, the access time should be constant

Task1: 
O(n) 
We need to go through each texts and calls once, and thus, we have the O(n) runtime

Task2: 
O(n) 
Similar to the scenario above, we need to go through each call once

Task3: 
O(n) 
In order to generate the final result, we need to go through each call once

Task4: 
Worst case O(n^2) if the dict hash algorithm is implemented horribly... 
first of all we need to loop through each item to build the whitelist,
and then again, we need to go through each outgoing calls to check if they start with 140 or not in the whitelist.
If the whitelist hash is good we can achieve O(n), otherwise, O(n^2)
