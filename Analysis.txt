Task0: 
O(1) 
To access an array with a given index, first or last, the access time should be constant

Task1: 
O(n) 
We need to go through each texts and calls once, and thus, we have the O(n) runtime

Task2: 
O(n) 
Similar to the scenario above, we need to go through each call once

Task3: 
Part A: O(nlogn) Part B: O(n)
For part A, in order to generate the final sorted result, we need to go through each call once O(n)
and then in the worst case if all the area codes need to be sorted, then we need O(nlogn) to perform the sort.
In terms of part B, we need to loop all the calls once, which is O(n)

Task4: 
O(nlogn)
first of all we need to loop through each item to build the whitelist O(n),
and then again, we need to go through each outgoing calls to check if they start with 140 or not in the whitelist.
And then sorting of the telemarketers will generate O(nlogn) overall
